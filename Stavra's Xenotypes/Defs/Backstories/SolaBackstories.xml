            Unable to ignore the overwhelmingly large heap of evidence, [PAWN_nameDef] became an ardent believer in the divinity of the Akunzoia; the long-extinct creator-species that is believed to have created the Sōla. Her eccentricity often drove people away, which only let her dive deeper into her studies, as well as her worship. Her devotion eventually culminated in the decision to leave Elīsia and venture out into the periphery of civilized space, searching for answers and for enlightenment.
